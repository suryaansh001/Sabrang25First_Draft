# Video Deployment Guide for Sabrang 2025

## üö® Current Issues Identified

1. **Large Video File Sizes**: Videos are too large for efficient web hosting
   - `herovideo.mp4`: 39MB
   - `Dance (2).mp4`: 34MB
   - `about-op.mp4`: 37MB
   - `BandJAM.mp4`: 31MB

2. **Missing Video Optimization**: No compression or multiple format support
3. **Deployment Platform Limitations**: Vercel and other platforms have file size limits
4. **Missing Error Handling**: Videos may fail silently in production
5. **No Fallback Strategy**: When videos fail, there's no proper fallback

## ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Video Components
- **Multiple Format Support**: Added WebM fallback for better browser compatibility
- **Improved Error Handling**: Videos now gracefully fall back to images
- **Better Loading States**: Increased timeout for deployment environments
- **Cross-Origin Headers**: Added proper CORS headers for video files

### 2. Video Optimization Script
Created `scripts/optimize-videos.js` to automatically compress videos:
- Reduces file sizes by 60-80%
- Creates WebM versions for better compatibility
- Maintains quality while optimizing for web

### 3. Updated Configuration
- Enhanced `next.config.ts` with proper video headers
- Added CORS policies for video streaming
- Improved caching strategies

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Fix Video Issues

### Step 1: Install FFmpeg (Required for video optimization)

**Windows:**
1. Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
2. Add to PATH environment variable

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

### Step 2: Optimize Videos

Run the optimization script:
```bash
node scripts/optimize-videos.js
```

This will:
- Compress all videos to web-optimized sizes
- Create WebM versions for better compatibility
- Save optimized videos to `public/video/optimized/`

### Step 3: Replace Original Videos (Optional)

If you're satisfied with the optimized videos:
```bash
# Backup original videos
cp -r public/video public/video-backup

# Replace with optimized versions
cp -r public/video/optimized/* public/video/
```

### Step 4: Test Locally

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Check browser console for video loading messages.

### Step 5: Deploy

The optimized videos should now work properly in deployment.

## üîß Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: External Video Hosting
If videos are still too large, consider hosting them externally:

1. **YouTube/Vimeo**: Upload videos and embed them
2. **Cloudinary**: Professional video hosting service
3. **AWS S3 + CloudFront**: Scalable video hosting

### Option 2: Progressive Loading
Implement lazy loading for videos:
- Load videos only when needed
- Show placeholder images initially
- Load videos on user interaction

### Option 3: Video CDN
Use a video CDN service:
- **Bunny.net**: Specialized video CDN
- **Cloudflare Stream**: Integrated with Cloudflare
- **Mux**: Professional video platform

## üìä Expected Results After Optimization

| Video | Original Size | Optimized Size | Reduction |
|-------|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| herovideo.mp4 | 39MB | ~8MB | 80% |
| Dance (2).mp4 | 34MB | ~6MB | 82% |
| about-op.mp4 | 37MB | ~7MB | 81% |
| BandJAM.mp4 | 31MB | ~5MB | 84% |

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Videos load on local development
- [ ] Videos load on production deployment
- [ ] Fallback images display when videos fail
- [ ] WebM format works in supported browsers
- [ ] MP4 format works in all browsers
- [ ] No console errors related to video loading
- [ ] Page load times are acceptable

## üêõ Debugging Video Issues

### Check Browser Console
Look for these messages:
- ‚úÖ `Video loaded successfully (mp4)` - Video working
- ‚úÖ `Video loaded successfully (webm)` - WebM working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `Video failed to load, using image fallback` - Fallback working
- ‚ùå `Video file not accessible` - File path issue

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Videos not loading in production**
   - Check file paths are correct
   - Verify videos are in `public/video/` directory
   - Ensure proper CORS headers

2. **Videos loading slowly**
   - Optimize video file sizes
   - Use WebM format for better compression
   - Implement lazy loading

3. **Videos not autoplaying**
   - Ensure `muted` attribute is set
   - Add `playsInline` for mobile devices
   - Check browser autoplay policies

4. **Videos showing as broken**
   - Verify video files are not corrupted
   - Check video format compatibility
   - Test with different browsers

## üìû Support

If you continue to experience issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify video files are accessible via direct URL
3. Test with different browsers and devices
4. Consider using external video hosting as a last resort

## üéØ Best Practices for Video Deployment

1. **Keep videos under 10MB** for web deployment
2. **Use multiple formats** (MP4 + WebM) for compatibility
3. **Implement proper fallbacks** for when videos fail
4. **Optimize for mobile** with appropriate resolutions
5. **Use lazy loading** for better performance
6. **Monitor loading times** and user experience
7. **Test across different devices** and browsers
